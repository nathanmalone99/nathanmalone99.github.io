        Better Call Saul is an American television crime drama series created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. It is a spin-off of Gilligan's prior series Breaking Bad, set in the early 2000s. The series follows the story of con-man turned small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), beginning six years before the events of Breaking Bad and showing his transformation into the persona of criminal for hire Saul Goodman. McGill becomes the lawyer for former police officer Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), whose skills allow him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The show premiered on AMC on February 8, 2015. The fifth season premiered on February 23, 2020, and a sixth and final season is scheduled to air in 2021.

            McGill is initially working as a low-paid lawyer with the back room of a nail salon as his home and office. His friend and romantic interest Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) works as a lawyer at the firm of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), where she and Jimmy once worked in the mailroom. Partners at HHM include Jimmy's nemesis Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian) and his brother Chuck McGill (Michael McKean). Ehrmantraut conducts illegal drug distribution with Nacho Varga (Michael Mando), in addition to becoming right-hand man for drug lord Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) who runs a fast food restaurant as a business front. Their operations are disrupted by members of the Salamanca crime family, including Lalo Salamanca (Tony Dalton). Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito all reprise their roles from Breaking Bad.
