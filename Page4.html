            In the present, Jesse flees the Brotherhood compound in Todd Alquist's El Camino. He goes to the Albuquerque home of Skinny Pete and Badger, who hide the car and give Jesse a place to sleep. The next morning, Jesse calls Old Joe to dispose of the El Camino but Joe leaves after discovering its LoJack. Pete then devises a plan to make it appear that Jesse fled to Mexico after trading Pete's Ford Thunderbird for the El Camino. Pete and Badger give Jesse the money they got from Walter, and Badger drives the Thunderbird several hours south while Pete stays home with the El Camino and awaits police. Jesse departs in Badger's Pontiac Fiero and learns from a radio news report that Walter died at the compound and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle is critically ill from being poisoned.

        <p>In a flashback to Jesse's captivity, Todd takes Jesse to Todd's apartment to help dispose of his cleaning lady, whom he killed after she discovered his hidden money.[N 3] They sidestep Lou, Todd's busybody neighbor and bury the corpse in the desert. In the present, Jesse sneaks into Todd's apartment and unsuccessfully searches for the cash. He hits the back of his head against Todd's refrigerator in frustration and hears something shift, leading him to the moneyâ€™s new hiding place inside its door. Two police officers enter the apartment and begin to search. Jesse hides but holds one, Casey, at gunpoint after Casey finds him. The other, Neil, disarms Jesse, who then realizes they are not police but thugs also looking for Todd's money. To save himself, Jesse reveals he found the cash, and Casey distracts Lou while Jesse and Neil bargain over dividing it. As they depart, Jesse recognizes Neil as the welder who built the tether he was fastened to while forced to cook meth for the Brotherhood.</p>
